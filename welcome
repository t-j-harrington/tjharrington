<p>Hello, and thank you for visiting my website. My name is Thomas Harrington, and I am a languages professional offering Japanese to English translation, alongside various other writing services such as copywriting, digital content creation and more.</p>
<p>Having lived and studied in Japan, and through my work on a variety of projects since, I have developed skills that can help you with your translation needs—be they advertising your products and services to an international market, gaining insights through localised market research, or subtitling your content to reach a larger audience.</p>
<p>Through translation, I have learned how to understand different cultures and clientele, and to craft messages that break boundaries—skills invaluable in creating impactful copy. Through working together with your business and understanding your needs, I can help you to craft messages, campaigns and content that resonate with your intended customers.</p>
<p>Whatever your project, communication is key in the delivery of effective writing. Please don't hesitate to contact me with the details of your project or a brief—and we can see how I can help you get your message out to the world.</p>
