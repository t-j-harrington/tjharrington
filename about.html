<h1>About me</h1>
<img src="" alt="A picture of the Tokyo skyline.">
<br/>
<p>I have always had an interest in both writing, and Japan. This led me to study Japanese at the University of Manchester in the UK, and Waseda University in Japan, graduating in 2016 with distinction in spoken Japanese and Translation.</p>
<p>Since graduating I have worked as a freelance translator, and have also worked in the market research, insurance, and software industriesâ€”developing an understanding of the needs of modern organisations and stakeholders.</p>
<p>In my work, I have been responsible for the review and improvement of hundreds of documents, ensuring that they are clear and understandable to a global audience. I apply these skills and knowledge to my translations.</p>
<p>I also work as a technical writer, understanding and explaining complex concepts in a clear and concise manner. I am a member of the Institute of Scienctific and Technical Communicators, and follow their code of practice. I am committed to developing my skills and improving my writing ability.</p>
<p>Being a translator, I understand the importance of conveying sentiment and meaning, a skill that has served me well in producing impactful and effective copy for a variety of clients.</p>
